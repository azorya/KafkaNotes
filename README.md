# KafkaNotes

To use kafka one must have [java](./JavaNotes.md) accesseble for it. 

Our first steps are:

*  [install & config our main components](./basic_installation_notes.md)
*  get some useful gui tools to work with [kafka](./cmka.md) and [schema_registry](./lenses.md)

Then we have a few excerices to illustrate basic command line tools usage.
