 **Schema-Registry-GUI**
 
 We use the following [schema-registry-ui](https://github.com/lensesio/schema-registry-ui).
 It gives a nice alternative to the plain _curl_ command.
 
 The built version is installed  on the _kafkaqamini1_ box in the _/home/zconsult/stage/schema-registry-ui_ directory.
 Please note that currently it could be used only from the local box.
 
 To build it "from scratch" one
 Our steps:
 1. get
 2. build
 3. configure
 4. run
 
 To get 
 export PATH=~/apps/node_js/bin:$PATH
